## Description
Welcome to Harvey's, a fun and interactive web application that brings text to life through text-to-speech technology. This project was developed as my final submission for CS50x, Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science course.

### Inspiration
The app is a tribute to one of the greatest TV series of all time, The Office, particularly paying homage to Michael and his quirky humor. Twenty years ago, Michael had his own form of artificial intelligence, and this app brings a piece of that nostalgia to the modern web.

### Features
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts user input into spoken words using advanced text-to-speech technology.
- **Interactive Interface**: Simple yet engaging UI that allows users to easily input text and hear it spoken.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive web design, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices and screen sizes.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web content.
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the web pages.
- **Python with Flask**: For server-side scripting and handling web requests.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design elements.

### How to Use
1. Visit the website [soon].
2. Enter your favorite quote or phrase into the input field.
3. Press enter to hear the text spoken out loud.
4. Explore the other sections of the website to learn more about the project and ME :)

### Development
This project was developed in a weekend, integrating knowledge and skills acquired during the CS50x course. It showcases the ability to blend different technologies and concepts to create a functional and entertaining web application **fast**
